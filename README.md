# ComputerGraphics 🌌🚀🪐🌎🛸🛰️
 
*Note: This game uses OpenGL.*

For this assignment, we developed an imaginative 3D World in Outer Space using the concepts we learned in Computer Graphics.\
The concepts we used include building models, simple animations (rotation, moving along certain axis), and rendering effects such as lighting, shading, and texturing.\

**There are two types of models:**
1. OpenGL Primitives (Quadrics objects, polygon) 
2. Loaded Model (obj files)
